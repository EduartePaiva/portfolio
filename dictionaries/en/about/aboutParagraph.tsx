                Since I was young I have always liked technology, I have always
                been curious to know how computers and software were made.
                Because of that, I chose a career with a focus on technology. I
                finished college in Systems Analysis and Development, graduating
                as a technologist. I continue to study programming daily with a
                focus on web development.

                What I like most about programming is the challenge of solving
                problems. I love the feeling of being immersed in solving a
                complex problem for hours. My main stack is React, Nextjs, Node,
                Express, but I am not limited only to the javascript ecosystem,
                I like other languages such as Rust, Python, Golang, I have an
                AWS account where I test various cloud technologies.

                When I&apos;m not coding, I like to play video games, watch
                geopolitical news, go to the gym, and read books in English. I
                am interested in books on human nature, personal enhancement,
                and biographies.
